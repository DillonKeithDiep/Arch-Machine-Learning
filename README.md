### Intro
This repository is a collection of notebooks and code implementations of classic learning algorithms to study machine learning from various sources available online and in textbooks (see below).

### Common Dependencies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook 
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- Keras
I suggest installing Anaconda for dependency management

### Sources
